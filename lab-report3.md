## Researching grep

grep is a command which is used to search files for lines containing a certain pattern. By default, it prints the matching lines.

It is a very versatile command which can be used to find a pattern in multiple files, or find the closest matching pattern too.

I found various applications and ways to use grep by checking the ``` man grep ``` command in the terminal.
